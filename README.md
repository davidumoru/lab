# Lab

This repository contains the source code for the experimental UI components, design engineering explorations, and micro-interactions showcased on my website.

This is where I play, test, and build interesting frontend things.

## Purpose

This lab serves as a personal space for:
* Crafting custom UI components from scratch.
* Exploring design engineering principles in practice.
* Experimenting with engaging micro-interactions and animations.
* Learning and applying new frontend technologies and techniques.

## Live Version

You can see these experiments live at: [https://davidumoru.me/lab]
