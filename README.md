# Lab

Source code for the UI experiments, interactive components, and design explorations featured on my website.

## What's Here

This space is for:
* Building custom components and interactions
* Testing new frontend techniques and libraries  
* Exploring animation and micro-interaction patterns
* Prototyping ideas before they become real projects
